## CPU (Central Processing Unit)

### 🔹 Definition
The **CPU** is the **central processing unit** that **executes instructions**, performs **arithmetic and logical operations**, and controls all system activities.

### 🔹 Key Points
- Known as the **brain of the computer**
- Executes program instructions
- Controls data flow between memory and devices

### 🔹 Simple Explanation
CPU **thinks, calculates, and makes decisions**.

---

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

### 🔹 Definition
**RAM** is a **volatile memory** that temporarily stores **data and programs currently being used** by the CPU.

### 🔹 Key Points
- Temporary memory
- Very fast compared to storage
- Data is lost when power is OFF
- CPU works directly with RAM

### 🔹 Simple Explanation
RAM is the **working area** of the computer.

---

## Cache Memory

### 🔹 Definition
**Cache memory** is a **small, high-speed memory located inside the CPU** that stores **frequently used instructions and data** to reduce access time.

### 🔹 Key Points
- Faster than RAM
- Smaller in size
- Located inside the CPU
- Improves system performance

### 🔹 Simple Explanation
Cache is the CPU’s **instant-access memory**.

---

## ROM (Read Only Memory)

### 🔹 Definition
**ROM** is a **non-volatile memory** that stores **firmware and booting instructions** required to start the computer.

### 🔹 Key Points
- Permanent memory
- Data is retained even when power is OFF
- Stores BIOS / UEFI
- Not used for running applications

### 🔹 Simple Explanation
ROM contains the **startup instructions** of the computer.

## Differences Between CPU, RAM, Cache, and ROM

| Feature | CPU | RAM | Cache | ROM |
|------|----|----|------|-----|
| Purpose | Executes instructions | Temporary storage | Speeds up CPU | Booting |
| Type | Processor | Volatile memory | High-speed memory | Non-volatile memory |
| Speed | Very fast | Fast | Fastest | Slow |
| Data loss on power OFF | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Size | — | GBs | KBs / MBs | Small |

---

## Booting Process

1. Power ON
2. ROM (BIOS / UEFI) executes
3. Operating System is loaded from SSD into RAM
4. CPU starts executing instructions

## Quick Interview One-Liners

- **CPU:** Executes instructions and controls the system
- **RAM:** Temporary working memory
- **Cache:** Fast memory inside the CPU
- **ROM:** Permanent startup memory
